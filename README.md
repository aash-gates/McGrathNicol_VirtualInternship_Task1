# Digital forensics & incident response
## Digital forensics &amp; incident response Commence and scope an incident response and forensic investigation into an Office 365 compromise.

As a first step, we will be liaising with our clientâ€™s IT Administrators and Network Personnel to determine the scope of the investigation and incident severity, and identify artefacts that will assist our investigation (e.g. logging from different network and host devices, network diagrams, forensic images of relevant workstations).

The client has already briefly run through the Infrastructure. Each user has a designated workstation running Windows 10 OS, with a single server operating Active Directory and being the primary Domain Controller. There is a single Qotom appliance running a pfSense software firewall that manages all network traffic for the company, as there are no web or application proxies running in the environment. They are primarily running a cloud setup with Office 365 being the primary storage for all mail and loose document data using SharePoint sites

To commence, we need to develop a plan of action and send it to the client with a cover email. 

The plan of action will outline:

Who we can talk to;
What information assets are to be forensically imaged/examined; and
What types of network logging that potentially could be relevant for collection and why (as we need to explain this to the client). Both network and end-point logs should be considered.
Your plan of action document should be:

Clear and concise; and 
No more than 1 A4 page in length. 
Your cover email attaching the plan of action should summarise:

The proposed steps to be taken; and 
What possible analysis could be conducted on the collected data.
